                                    p.pb10 Crowdfunding is a powerful tool that can help your business raise more than money. You have the ability to turn your customers into owners, who can then become brand ambassadors and evangelists, spreading the word about your product or service. The crowd can help you gauge demand for your product and provide input to help you refine your offering. The crowd can also provide the knowledge and experience you might seek to bring you to the next level.

                                    p.pb10 James Surowiecki wrote a book called The Wisdom of Crowds, where he demonstrates that often the collective wisdom of crowds is more accurate than that of an expert; by obtaining a large number of independent opinions, you can de-correlate error and arrive at a more accurate assessment.

                                    p.pb10 There are no assurances that any campaign will be successful or will secure enough investor commitments to reach a minimum target. Each crowdfunding investment will involve risk to the investor who must rely on their own examination of the issuer and the terms of the offering.

                                            | PayBack Share is a revenue share agreement. If you choose PayBack Share, you would make annual payments to your investors of at least 5% of your revenue until two times (2x) the amount invested is paid back. No distributions would be required until the second full calendar year and you would also be allowed one year of forbearance as needed.  These obligations would be unsecured and contain no pre-payment penalty. This security may be a good choice for:

                                        li It does not dilute the ownership of current shareholders or the control of management 

                                        li It avoids a prolonged negotiation over valuation and “messy cap table”

                                        li It may be easier to raise capital and attract investors by offering the potential to earn regular cash distributions

                                        li It gives you the chance to keep more of the upside since once investors’ have received 2x their money back, you will have no further obligation

                                       | Additionally, when compared to most bank loans or other forms of financing, the Payback Share approach provides entrepreneurs with less risk exposure since it requires no collateral or personal guarantee.   We designed Payback Share to be a flexible repayment mechanism that does not contain many of the financial covenants that would be found in a typical bank loan.
