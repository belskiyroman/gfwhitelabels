            h3.m0 PayBack Share is a revenue share agreement that may be a good choice for:
            ul.simple-list.list-style-alphabet.mb45
                li.mt15 Companies that generate or expect to generate cash (your operating earnings will have to be &gt; 5% of your revenue for this to make sense);
                li.mt15 LLC&rsquo;s that are looking for ways to raise funds without the need to issue K-1s; and
                li.mt15 Companies that want to maintain a clean capital structure in anticipation of a future venture capital fundraising round.

            h3.m0 Here&apos;s how it works:
            ol.simple-list.mb45
                li.mt15 You share at least 5% of your revenue annually;
                li.mt15 No distribution is required until the second full calendar year and you are allowed one year of forbearance as needed;
                li.mt15 Distributions are capped at 2x the invested amount, at which point your obligation is fulfilled.

            h3.m0 Here are some of the advantages of choosing PayBack Share:
            ol.simple-list.mb45
                li.mt15 It does not dilute the ownership of current shareholders or the control of management
                li.mt15 It avoids a prolonged negotiation over valuation and &ldquo;messy cap table&rdquo;
                li.mt15 It may be easier to raise capital and attract investors by offering the potential to earn regular cash distributions
                li.mt15 It gives you the chance to keep more of the upside since once investors&rsquo; have received 2x their money back, you will have no further obligation
